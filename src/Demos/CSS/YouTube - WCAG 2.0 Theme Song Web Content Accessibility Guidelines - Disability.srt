5
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:31,000
We got a brand new specification it works with the tool of verification

00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:34,000

00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:14,003
You know David, I saw a guy on TV say that he's the fastest rapper in the world, but I'm way faster, I blow him away, watch this

16
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:20,003
Sharky raps at 250 words a minute

17
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:29,003
I'm a cool DJ, Sharky, WCAG. I like techno geek music. How's that David, am I a cool rapper now?

18
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,003
David: Sharky, I couldn't understand a word you said.

19
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,003
Sharky: Most of my blind friends understand everything when I speak at that speed

20
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:39,003
(slowly) Would you like me to speak really slow for you David?

21
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:43,700
David: That's very funny, c'mon let's sing this verse together.

22
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,003
We're gonna make the web a better place For every ability and every race

It's not a heavy load  to open up your code and write the WCAG, WCAG

28
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,003
So let me tell you what the WCAG is  And what the WCAG's not

29
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,003
The WCAG is a set of tools Comes with a set of rules

30
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:23,007
Help your web site come to life For people with other abilities And sensabilities

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,003
So when they hit you online They can have a good time

32
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,007
Don't matter if they're blind Or if they have to sign

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,007
Or if their hands start to shake  With every move they make

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,007
Or if their minds get confused with what they want to do

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,007
They can easily figure out  What you are talking about When you follow the principles that we're gonna lay out

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,007
Principle 1: Content must be Perceivable

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,007
Principle 2: Interface elements in the content must by Operable

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Principle 3:  Content and controls must be Understandable

39
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:02,100
Principle 4: Content must be Robust, enough to work with current and future technologies

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:15,120
We wanna show you the WCAG We wanna show you what this world can be

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,100
We wanna show you the WCAG

42
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:26,100
It's not a heavy load  to open up your code and write the WCAG, WCAG

43
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,100
Hey David, your music is much more funky since you moved out of the suburbs and started hanging out downtown on street corners.

44
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,100
I like the other theme song but it sounded a bit too unplugged and I've never been crazy about an unplugged sound,

45
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,100
I like techno geek music where computers do everything and humans don't play any instruments.

46
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,100
I think it is a lot more organic when music is played buy genuine computers.

47
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,100
When humans play it sounds so unemotionable and fake.

48
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,100
David: We'll that's just because you're a bunch of ones and zeros there big guy.

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,130
Sharky: David, that was very mean of you to say that, you know I've always been very sensitive out my binary genetic coding.

50
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,130
It's always been a source of great emotional insecurity for me.

51
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:59,130
David: Oh, c'mon Sharky, you know I love you man, and besides, you are an awesome rapper, man you should go into American Idol.

52
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,130
Sharky: I'm going to be a star, I can see the headlines now, Sharky wins American Idol for people with disabilities.
